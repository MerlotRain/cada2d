Circles of Apollonius

The circles of Apollonius are any of several sets of circles associated with Apollonius of Perga, 
a renowned Greek geometer. Most of these circles are found in planar Euclidean geometry, 
but analogs have been defined on other surfaces; for example, counterparts on the surface 
of a sphere can be defined through stereographic projection.
